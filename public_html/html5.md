I decided to use a different game, a brick breaker.

Modifcation 1:
 - The base game was using a mouse drag but I decided to change it to right and left arrows.
    
Modification 2: 
 - Added a key command to pause and resume the game, using esc.

Other Mods and what I learned: 
 - Changed the background and object colors.
 - Added a border around the canvas.I also changed the speed of the ball to give a little more challenge.
 - During this lesson I really had to study the syntax and functions of the game to really understand how to change any of the game.
 - In addition I researched a lot of different methods to pause the game and finally found one that worked for this particular game.
